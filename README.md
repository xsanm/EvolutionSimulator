**What is EvolutionSimulator?**

EvolutionSimulator allows you to simulate a simple population where animals fed, breed with each other and their children inherit their genes.

**How it works?**

* Map is divided into two parts
* In one day one grass is spawned in each part (randomly choosed fields)
* Animal decides which way will move
* Animal without energy die
* If animals share field with grass - the strongest animal eats and gain energy
* If animals share field - two strongest breed 
* More details here: https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/tree/master/proj1


**Genes inheritance**

* Genotype is splitted to three parts
* Select two parts from stronger parent, one from weaker
* Make sure that at least one occurence of each gene is present
